This project (now deprecated) gets all the available data from the "Know your Class and Section"'s API using a post request on the pesuacademy website (which has since been taken down).
Implemented using bs4 and requests, unlike the previous one which was based on selenium.
A much faster version is implemented using threading.

This scraper comes in 2 variants:-
- Sequential
- Multithreaded
The code is almost identical except for threading.
